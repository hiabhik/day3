      An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent
      element that has a position other than static. A relative positioned
      element is positioned relative to its normal position. To position an
      element relatively, the property position is set as relative.

    <h4>What is grid-template-columns used for?</h4>
    <p>

      of columns in a grid layout. The values are a space separated list, where
      each value specifies the size of the respective column.Its default value
      is none.

    <h4>What is the z-index in CSS?</h4>
    <p>
      Z Index ( z-index ) is a CSS property that defines the order of
      overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on
      top of elements with a lower index.If two positioned elements overlap
      without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code
      will be shown on top. <br> <br>

    <h4>What is the difference between padding and margin?</h4>
    <p>
      In CSS, a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is
      the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put
      another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element,
      and the padding property controls the space inside an element.  <br> <br>

    <h4>What is box sizing?</h4>
    <p>
      The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an
      element is calculated. content-box: This is the default value of the
      box-sizing property. In this mode, the width and height properties include
      only the content. Border and padding are not included in it i.e if we set
      an element’s width to 200 pixels, then the element’s content box will be
      200 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to
      the final rendered width. Syntax: box-sizing: content-box; <br /><br />
      border-box: In this mode, the width and height properties include content,
      padding, and borders i.e if we set an element’s width to 200 pixels, that
      200 pixels will include any border or padding we added, and the content
      box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much
      easier to size elements. <br> <br>

    <h4>What is animation delay?</h4>

      applying the animation to an element before beginning to perform the
      animation. The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning,
      or immediately and partway through the animation.

    <h4>Explain CSS box model</h4>
    <p>
      The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML
      element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual
      content.
    </p>
    <h4>what is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</h4>
    <p>
      Display:none hides the element from the page, and the space it would take
      up on the page can be used by other elements. visibility:hidden hides the
      elements, but it continues to consume the space it normally would.
